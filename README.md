# Bio-Diversity
The Bio/Diversity Project's data science track of our environmental science outreach internship program.
Led by PI Dr. Katy Prudic and coordinated by Dr. Ellen Bledsoe and Elena Greenberg, the new data science outreach is a 2-year NSF-funded collaborative research opportunity. "Building Capacity in Data Science through Biodiversity, Conservation, and General Education" provides outreach interns robust training and mentorship from local experts and pairs interns with high school teachers to facilitate data science curriculum through the lens of biodiversity conservation.
