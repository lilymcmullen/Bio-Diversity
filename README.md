# Bio/Diversity Project: Data Science Outreach Lesson Plans
Welcome to the Bio/Diversity Project Data Science Outreach Program! This repository contains lesson plans designed for use in our data science-focused outreach in local Title 1 schools. These lessons integrate environmental science with data science concepts, offering middle and high school students an introduction to coding and analysis within a real-world context.

## Directory Structure
Each repository is organized by partner school. Directories contain eight lessons, each developed by the Bio/Diversity staff and interns.
